# Clustering

Clustering in Machine Learning is one of the main method used in the unsupervised learning technique for statistical data analysis by classifying population or data points of the given dataset into several groups based upon the similar features or properties, while the datapoint in the different group poses the highly dissimilar property or feature. 

- The clustering methods used in machine learning (i.e., **k-mean clustering, Density methods, Grid-based methods, Hierarchical bases method**, etc.) perform the data pointsâ€™ collection based upon the similarity and dissimilarity between them.
